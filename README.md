# sicss-gis-with-r
This repo serves as the basis for my SICSS talk on "GIS and Spatial Analysis with R" and provides a comprehensive guide to using R for GIS and spatial analysis. The focus of the repository is on utilizing the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED) to analyze and visualize the war in Ukraine throughout the year 2022.
