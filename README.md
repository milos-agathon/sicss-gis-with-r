# SICSS Istanbul 2023: GIS and spatial analysis with R

The repository "GIS and Spatial Analysis with R" provides a guide to using R for GIS and spatial analysis. We'll analyze and visualize civilian fatalities in the Russia-Ukraine war throughout 2022. The primary dataset used in this repository is the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced Event Dataset - [UCDP GED](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/index.html#ged_global)

The repository includes code examples that demonstrate how to work with spatial data, perform geospatial analysis, and create compelling visual representations using R. It covers topics such as data acquisition, data preprocessing, spatial analysis techniques, and visualization methods.
