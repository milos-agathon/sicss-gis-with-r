# SICSS Istanbul 2023: GIS and spatial analysis with R

The repository "GIS and Spatial Analysis with R" provides a comprehensive guide to using R for GIS and spatial analysis. The focus of the repository is on utilizing the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED) to analyze and visualize the war in Ukraine throughout the year 2022.

The repository includes code examples, step-by-step tutorials, and interactive visualizations that demonstrate how to work with spatial data, perform geospatial analysis, and create compelling visual representations using R. It covers topics such as data acquisition, data preprocessing, spatial analysis techniques, and visualization methods.

The primary dataset used in this repository is the UCDP GED, which provides detailed information about conflict events and their geographical locations. By leveraging R's spatial analysis capabilities, users can explore and uncover insights about the war in Ukraine, including patterns, trends, and spatial relationships within the conflict data.

Through this repository, users will gain a practical understanding of how to harness the power of R for GIS and spatial analysis, specifically in the context of analyzing and visualizing the war in Ukraine using the UCDP GED. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced R user, this repository offers valuable resources to enhance your spatial analysis skills and gain deeper insights into complex conflicts.
